# Supply-Chain-HR-Reporting-Monthly

This README file is for an interactive Excel dashboard for analyzing employee turnover of an organization’s various supply chain locations. It provides a clear and professional overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and how to use it.

About

This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to help Supply Chain HR management visualize and analyze employee turnover metrics. The dashboard leverages Excel features such as VLOOKUPs, SUMIFs, COUNTIFs, graphs and charts. The visible face of the dashboard references a hidden Data tab copied and pasted as values from a separate sheet with an interlocking matrix of formulaic capture forms. The dashboard provides a dynamic and clear view of headcount, termination, and hire trends over time. This tool allows HR users and facility management to make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention strategies.

Executive Summary 

The Business Problem: Elevated employee turnover is an issue across the organization’s supply chain locations. The average termination leads to a replacement Cost Per Hire (CPH) of ~$4,000 from initial recruiting costs to 13 week ramp up training costs.

The Solution: Tracking employee turnover at a granular level can help HR management develop retention strategies to counter some of the most common turnover leaving reasons. Various retention KPIs such as headcount, terminations, and new hires are displayed by facility.

Next steps: Strict attendance policies can be slackened with flexible scheduling between first and second shifts. No cell phone policies designed for the 1990s can be amended to reflect the realities of current times. Temp to Hire policies can be further augmented to ensure that employees are cognizant of the realities of long shifts in an unairconditioned environment.

The Impact: Although high turnover in certain difficult environments is at least partially unavoidable, any elimination of unnecessary employee churn is welcome. Following the above recommendations reduced overall supply chain turnover by approximately 10%.

Dashboard Features

Building Snapshot: This sheet allows users to scroll through the various locations to determine the root causes of employee turnover. Location turnover is further broken down between Distribution and Transportation departments whose workers are paid on different pay scales.

Headcount Display: A chart displaying overall facility headcount, mostly helpful for regional and HR to scroll though their locations of responsibility and quickly eye headcount trends.

New Hire Comp Ratio: A display of the New Hire compensation trends of the supply chain facilities. Locations had guidance to hire a proportion of hires within the 80 to 85 percent compensation band . . . They did not always follow this guidance leading to unnecessary turnover in competitive warehouse wage markets.

Turnover By Location: Provides an overall matrix of all supply chain locations, providing Monthly, Year to Date (YTD), and Annualized turnover metrics for side-by-side comparative analysis. Regional metrics and yearly metrics are also available for analysis.

Skills Used

Microsoft Excel: Used for all data manipulation, calculations, and visualization.

SQL: Used to customize the backend reporting (Headcount, Terminations, and New Hires) fed into the capture forms.

Excel Charts: Used to create all the visual components of the dashboard.
